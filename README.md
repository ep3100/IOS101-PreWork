## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

- Google
    - Able to take a photo of an unknown language and translate into a known one
    - Able to take a photo of an object and find it on the internet (say a pair of shoes you want to find)
    
- Grubhub
    - Allows you to contact your delivery driver
    - Allows you to see the current location of your delivery driver
    
- Anki
    - Has an SRS system for memorization; shows you stuff more frequently if you forget it and less frequently the more you remember it
    - Extremely customizable; also allows for one to download someone elses deck and make personal changes
    
- I've been playing piano and guitar for a good while now and have been interested in creating a useful app for musicians looking to learn new songs. The gist of it is that it uses your mic to listen out for chords being playing at an instant; you could play a C major chord on an instrument, then the app would hear it and tell you that it's a C major chord. You could also play a song and it would show you the chords as it plays by. Additionally it would show you how to play that chord on various instruments. I have looked at this in the past and discovered Fast-Fourier Transform for chord detection; it was complicated so I'm not sure how easy this project would be.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

N/A besides quite slow loading times for running the simulation.
